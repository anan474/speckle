# Speckle

A JavaScript module that adds responsive, stylized speckles to any element; with no dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```js
npm install speckle-js
```

### Usage

Import the module using ES6.

```js 
import Speckle from 'speckle-js';
```

The module can also be required using CommonJS.

```js 
const Speckle = require('speckle-js');
```

Use the constructor by passing a valid HTML element as the first argument, and an options object of `key: value` pairs as the second argument.

```js 
new Speckle(element, options);
```
